# External Integration with Team 1

## Contributing Guidelines

* It is good programming practice that commit messages that follow a standard. For our project, kindly use the standard given [here](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

* the ```src``` folder contains your source code and the ```ext``` folder should contain external libraries, if any.

* It is also good practice to never write code to the ```master``` branch directly.

* Code should be written in a per-feature basis. Every new feature should branch off of ```dev``` and when ready, make a Pull/Merge request to ```dev``` . The ```dev``` branch should then be merged with ```master``` when the code is stable enough
